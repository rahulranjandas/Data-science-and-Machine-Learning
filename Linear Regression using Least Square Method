What is Linear Regression?
    Linear Regession is a form of predictive modelling which investigates the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable.
    
Consider an equation of a simple line, 
    Y = mX + c
    
    Y - Dependent Variable
    X - Independent Variable
    m - +/- slope
    c - Y intercept
    
Criteria of selecting Linear Regression
